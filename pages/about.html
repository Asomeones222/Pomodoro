            <h3>What is Pomodoro?</h3>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses
                a
                kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
                Each
                interval is
                known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo
                used as a
                university student.<br><strong>-Wikipedia</strong></p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>How do I use the Pomodoro technique?</h3>
            <p>Start the study session, which lasts 25 minutes. Include the tasks you want to finish during the session
                and
                mark them
                as done once you have finished them. Once the study session is up, the rest session will start, which
                lasts 5
                minutes.
                After every three study sessions, a 15-minute break session will start, allowing you to have more time
                to rest.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>How do I use this website?</h3>
            <p>Click the Start button to start the timer and enter a new task in the "Create a new todo" field. When you
                finish a task, click on the circle on the left to
                mark it as
                done. If you want to delete a task instead, click on the remove button to delete it. You can filter by
                Active,
                Completed, or All
                tasks. If you want to delete all tasks, click the Clear button. Once the study session concludes the
                timer will
                switch to the rest session. After every three study sessions a break session will start.
